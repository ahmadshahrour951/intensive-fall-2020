# Socialorm

This is a website that allows students to meet and socialize within their dormatries. Think of it more of a mashup of Tinder and Discord but for student dorms! Students would have to enter personal information like their name, age, dorm room, biography and the top things they like in a submit type format in the profile page. Then, they'll be able to see that same information from other students in the dormatories. This helps instigate conversations and help build a community! This web app will only be a demo of the idea.
